# Matrix-Rotation
Rotating a matrix by a factor of R

This is the code for rotating a matrix by a factor of r (taken as input).
While solving this problem, care must be taken to rotate ALL the elements.
The solution presented here takes an approach of doing the rotation in spirals.
So in the first iteration the outermost circle of the matrix is rotated.
The rotation is done only once by r for each element.
In the second iteration, we remove the outermost circle and take the second
circle, and rotate it.
We continue till we reach the innermost circle.
After rotating the innermost circle, the rotation of the matrix is complete.
